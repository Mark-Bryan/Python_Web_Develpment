            hours, except between 1962 and 1966, and in 1972, when it featured
            different durations. During this time, the Maranello manufacturer

            recent class victory was in 2024, when official drivers Davide

            triumphed in GTD Pro with Risi Competizione’s 296 GT3 after 733
            laps. In the annals of Ferrari history and the minds of its tifosi,
            the 1967 victory stands out, with Lorenzo Bandini and Chris Amon
